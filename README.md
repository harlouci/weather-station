# weather

Project to predict weather. We are using the dataset found at 

https://github.com/PacktPublishing/EngineeringMLOps/blob/master/03_Code_Meets_Data/Dataset/weather_dataset_raw.csv

Our goal is to predict the weather fours in advance. More specicaly if it's will rain in 4 hours. This city is a port town. So knowing if there will be rain help the fisherman to know if they should go in the sea.
