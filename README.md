# Weather Prediction

Project to predict the weather at the Port of Turku, in Finland. We are using the dataset found at 

https://github.com/PacktPublishing/EngineeringMLOps/blob/master/03_Code_Meets_Data/Dataset/weather_dataset_raw.csv

Knowing in advance whether it's going to rain or not helps the port's dockers to manage their schedules, in particular to know whether they should stay at home or not.


# Install

```
conda create -n weather python=3.10
conda activate weather
pip install -e .[all]
```
